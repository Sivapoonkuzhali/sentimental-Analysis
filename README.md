# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on tweets collected from **Twitter** using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source:** Twitter API (using Tweepy or similar)
* **Format:** `.csv` with fields like `tweet_id`, `text`, `created_at`, `user`, and `sentiment`
* **Labels:** `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`

> Note: Due to Twitter's API policy, raw tweet text may be omitted or anonymized.

## ⚙️ Features

* Data preprocessing: removing mentions, hashtags, URLs, emojis
* Tokenization and vectorization (TF-IDF or Word Embeddings)
* Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, SVM, or Naive Bayes
* Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
* Optional: Deep learning using LSTM or BERT

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-twitter.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-twitter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook or training script**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/sentiment-analysis.ipynb
   # or
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

---

## 📈 Results

* Model Accuracy: \~85% (varies depending on the model and data)
* Sentiment distribution chart
* Word clouds for each sentiment

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK / SpaCy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Tweepy (for data collection)

---

## 📌 Future Work

* Integrate BERT or RoBERTa for improved accuracy
* Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
* Real-time Twitter stream sentiment dashboard
